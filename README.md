There are basic operations overloaded for numbers with (<= 10^5) digits

### building on linux

0. make sure you compiler support c++11 features
1. clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/ampawd/bigUnsignedInteger.git or download directly)
3. `cd bigUnsignedInteger`
2. `mkdir build && cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`
5. `./biguint`
