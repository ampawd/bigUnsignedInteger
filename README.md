### Small experimental library for big unsigned integers (up to 10^5 decimal digits)

There are basic operations overloaded for large unsigned integers, 2 algorithms implemented to compute square root, and binary pow

### building on linux

0. make sure you compiler supports C++11 features
1. clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/ampawd/bigUnsignedInteger.git or download directly)
3. `cd bigUnsignedInteger`
2. `mkdir build && cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`
5. `./biguint`
